# Scripting with Python

Scripts to manipulate data and run other tasks, written in Python.

## Usage

Create two local directories: `data` and `output`. These directories are not tracked by git and should be used for any data transformation.

## Installation

If you require the modules to work with the Google Cloud Platform, use the `google-requirements.txt` file:

```
pip install -r ./requirements/google-requirements.txt
```
